# ITM411_Final_Project_Tokar_Mykola
This is my final project for Intermediate Software Development course. Unfortunately, professor changed the password for the database after the end of the class, so you cannot run it as it is, but if you have your own database the only thing you need is to adjust a link. 
Example of database you can find in the main folder.
